You are a junior data engineer at a global health analytics firm. Your task is to explore and prepare COVID-19 time series data from various countries. The raw data comes in CSV formâ€”your goal is to make it analysis-ready and generate some basic insights using Pandas and NumPy.
# INSIGHTS FROM COVID 19 DATASET
## COVID Time Series Analysis with Pandas & NumPy

### âœ… Key Tasks Completed
- Grouped time-series data by country
- Aggregated global confirmed cases
- Used `.diff()` to calculate daily new cases
- Identified India's peak daily new cases: **414,188 on 5/6/21**
- Global confirmed as of 3/9/23: **676,570,149**
- Global new cases on 3/9/23: **177,325**

### ðŸ§  Reflection
This dataset shows how real-world data is both powerful and messy. I learned how to extract meaningful insights using basic Pandas operationsâ€”and uncovered headline-level data from scratch. Handling negative values, cleaning groupings, and visualizing trends all taught me how critical data engineering is in real analysis.
